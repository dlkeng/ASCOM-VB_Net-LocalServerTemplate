The script generator saves the information in an Inno script in the Focuser's
project folder and opens Inno Script Studio.

12) In Inno Script Studio, change the [Setup]AppSupportURL to "http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ASCOM-Talk/"
13) In Inno Script Studio, change the [Setup]OutputBaseFilename to "Acme Focuser Setup"
14) In Inno Script Studio, replace the contents of the [Files] section with:
     Source: ".\bin\Debug\ASCOM.Acme.Focuser.dll"; DestDir: "{app}"
     Source: ".\ReadMe.htm"; DestDir: "{app}"; Flags: isreadme
15) Save any changes
16) Make sure solution is closed in the Visual Studio IDE and
    compile the Inno script with Project->Compile
17) Exit Inno Script Studio

The driver setup EXE is now located in the Focuser project folder as: Acme Focuser Setup.exe

18) Run the setup's Acme Focuser Setup.exe to install the Acme Focuser driver

19) Verify the following files are added in: 
    C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\ASCOM\Focuser
     - ASCOM.Acme.Focuser.dll
     - ReadMe.htm
20) Verify the following folder and files are added in: 
    C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\ASCOM\Uninstall\Focuser\Acme
     - unins000.dat
     - unins000.exe

At this point, the Acme Focuser driver should be available for use.

21) Run the 32-bit ASCOM Conform tool, choose the ASCOM Focuser Driver for Acme.,
    Check Conformance and verify that no errors, warnings or issues are found and the Focuser
    driver passes ASCOM validation!!
22) Run the 64-bit ASCOM Conform tool, choose the ASCOM Focuser Driver for Acme.,
    Check Conformance and verify that no errors, warnings or issues are found and the Focuser
    driver passes ASCOM validation!!

23) Run the Windows uninstall tool to uninstall ASCOM Acme Focuser Driver 1.2
24) Verify the following files have been removed from: 
    C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\ASCOM\Focuser
     - ASCOM.Acme.Focuser.dll
     - ReadMe.htm
25) Verify the following folder (and its files) has been removed from: 
    C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\ASCOM\Uninstall\Focuser
     - Acme

At this point, the Acme Focuser should no longer be available in Conform's Select Driver.
Note: If the driver was installed on a 64-bit O.S., after the uninstall, some
      of the registry entries associated with the 64-bit install still remain
      in the registry. This is a known issue!
      (Work-around: In the Inno Setup script, in the [UninstallRun] section,
       after the "{dotnet4032}\regasm.exe" line, add a "{dotnet4064}\regasm.exe"
       line, copied from the [Run] section, to re-register the 64-bit driver
       immediately before unregistering it.)
